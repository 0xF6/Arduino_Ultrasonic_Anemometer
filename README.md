# Advanced RPI4 Weather Station 

Built upon an array of 6-ultrasonicâ€™s facing each other in 3-dimentions as an
anenometer, A DHT22 for air temperature & humidity, soil sensor, and other add-ons available according to your application,the device is powered by solar energy to make it fully autonomous as it is built to act as a local very accurate weather station for precision agricultural application , the device relays it's data to FarmOS instance either on web or locally hosted on the RPI .
This Product is the first of Farmtopia IOF Line and it's opensourced to support GODAN mission for easy & open agriculutral data 
it can work both stationary and mobile and can be easy replicated at home as described here 
## Measured Data
Measured Data| How
------------ | -------------
Wind speed & frequency in 3-dimentional direction | By calculating Ultrasonic error
Temperature & humidity | Am2301 Sensor
Soil Mositure | Resistive soil sensor


Measured Data How
Wind speed in 3-dimentional direction Ultrasonic based technology for the speed of sound in air
Temperature & humidity across different areas and
objects (soil , air , water , planets)
Soil temperature sensor , IR temperature sensor & air temperature
